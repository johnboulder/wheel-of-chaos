# Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## 1. Install node version manager `nvm`
You can follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating). 

This tool is very useful in general for managing the version of node you're on if you frequently develop
on different projects using different versions of node.

## 2. Run `nvm use` 
This sets the version of node your system uses to the version this project is configured to use.

_Note that if you do not have the project's version of node, you'll need to install it using `nvm install <version>`_

This version is  set in `.nvmrc`

## 3. Run `npm install`


## 4. Run `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


## Other scripts: 
### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
